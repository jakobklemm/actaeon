#+TITLE: Actaeon

Distributed PubSub and Messaging protocol for decentralized real time
application.

* Goals
- To provide a simple, easy to use library for general purpose
  decentralized networking.
- Enable custom components and functions through a modular design.
  
* Architecture
- The user needs to define the config (load from file) and the center
  (local kademlia values).
- Start the application, internally a dedicated listening thread is started.
- In the game loop or other application logic blocking or nonblocking
  calls can be made to fetch messages from the system, as well as send
  them.
- The system should automatically take care of routing, verification
  and signaling without requiring any manuall management, without
  denying the user the ability to change relevant settings.
