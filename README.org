#+TITLE: Actaeon

Distributed PubSub and messaging protocol for decentralized real time
applications.

* Goals
- To provide a simple, easy to use library for general purpose
  decentralized networking.
- Enable custom components and functions through a modular design.
  
* Architecture
- The user needs to define the config (load from file) and the center
  (local kademlia values).
- Start the application, internally a dedicated listening thread is started.
- In the game loop or other application logic blocking or nonblocking
  calls can be made to fetch messages from the system, as well as send
  them.
- The system should automatically take care of routing, verification
  and signaling without requiring any manuall management, without
  denying the user the ability to change relevant settings.

| Passive Message           | Message not for this node, handled by the Kademlia system. |
| Active Message            | Message for this and and for the user.                     |
| Automatic Message         | Message for this node but handled internally.              |
| Actaeon process / process | Dedicated thread for receiving messages.                   |
| Center                    | Self / this, local node.                                   |
