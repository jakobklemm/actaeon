#+TITLE: Actaeon

Distributed PubSub and messaging protocol for decentralized real time
applications.

* Goals
- To provide a simple, easy to use library for general purpose
  decentralized networking.
- Enable custom components and functions through a modular design.
  
* Architecture
- The user needs to define the config (load from file) and the center
  (local kademlia values).
- Start the application, internally a dedicated listening thread is started.
- In the game loop or other application logic blocking or nonblocking
  calls can be made to fetch messages from the system, as well as send
  them.
- The system should automatically take care of routing, verification
  and signaling without requiring any manuall management, without
  denying the user the ability to change relevant settings.
* Concurrency
Currently the threading model is all hard coded, in the future a more
modular system has to be implemented.
- Acceptor Thread: Listens for new incoming TCP connections. It runs
  in an continuous loop, only being active when a new connection
  arrives, at which point it creates a connection object and passes it
  on the system. No actual messages are processed on this thread.
- Handler Thread: On the handler thread Connections can get
  periodically processed when needed. 
* Terminology
| Term                     | Explanation                                                |

| Adapter                  | External interface                                         |
| Passive Message          | Message not for this node, handled by the Kademlia system. |
| Active Message           | Message for this and and for the user.                     |
| Automatic Message        | Message for this node but handled internally.              |
| Handler thread / process | Dedicated thread for receiving messages.                   |
| Center                   | Self / this, local node.                                   |
| Provider                 | Location of the PubSub entry                               |
|                          |                                                            |
* Issues
List of known urgent issues.
- Signaling: The server currently has to be available. -> Replace with
  Array & make variable to only copy the closest.
